# weather-dashboard



This is still very much a work in progress. I believe that I have the for loop figured out which is in the script-test.js. Planning to come back to this after completing the group project to add the loop and localstorage function.

The current version of the app is deployed here:    https://nigelloch.github.io/weather-dashboard/
